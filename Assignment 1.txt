<p>I am an Australian citizen living in Brisbane who works as a Supply Chain Manager for a Marine Construction company conducting projects around the world. I have worked around Australia, in Indonesia, Singapore, Egypt, Nigeria, Belgium and Germany.</p>
<p>I am studying a Bachelor of Business: Logistics and Supply Chain Management which I begun in mid-2016 and am in my final few units. In SP4 2019 I enrolled in Introduction to Information Technology as an elective, but was informed from student services that this unit was too similar to another compulsory unit and that if completed, I would not receive credit for IIT. Happily, the compulsory unit is not available until 2021 and IIT is the substitute unit!</p>
<p>Outside of work and study I am a novice powerlifter who was preparing for my first sanctioned meet in Sydney in May, which unfortunately looks like it will be cancelled.</p>

<h1>Interest in Information Technology</h1>
<p>My interest in IT was sparked as a teenager, through video games, and then again through the course of my career, having witnessed the growing capabilities and usage of IoT, among others, in industry. Particularly clear to me is the moment our Manager Director sent through the profiles of two IoT companies with the message “Find a useful application of these platforms on your project and report back to me”.</p>
<p>My experience in IT is reasonably limited, stemming from learning in studies and everyday professional activities. I am a competent user of the basic Office suite, have taken part in development of our proprietary ERP, entirely as a key user, and am a user of other data platforms, such as Power BI. </p>
<p>I chose to study at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology due to the major they offered, Logistics and Supply Chain Management. My choices at the time through distance learning was a the Diploma to Professional Diploma pathway through the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, a Bachelor of Business through RMIT, Griffith or UniSA, or the Bachelor of Business: Logistics and Supply Chain Management with RMIT. Due to the delivery method, specificity, learning pathways and career opportunities I decided upon RMIT and have never regretted the choice.</p>
<p>During the Introduction to Information Technology unit I expect to garner cursory knowledge about useful platforms and applications of IT. I still have one elective unit to complete and I seek to select a unit outside of my typical knowledge-base while still learning something with relevancy to my chosen occupation. Not having any experience with programming, my initial goal is to learn about the uses of programming, abilities and capabilities of different programming languages, and to reflect upon the useful applications of programming languages in my everyday professional activities.</p>

<h2>About the job - Fleet Manager - Containers and General with Toll Group</h2>
<p>The desired position, Fleet Manager – Containers and General, is a management role based in Brisbane for a large multi-national company. It fits my experience in international freight, managing multiple sites with inventory, their own network of deliverables, and my experiences with large-volume cargo such as containers and irregular freight. It would require the applicant to manage operational and strategic goals, providing satisfaction in completion of tangible objectives, as well as significant higher-level strategy and process development, implementation and improvement. In addition it is based in my home-town, ending a streak of 9-years of location work and it is with a well-known, reputable organization with room to climb.</p>
<h2>How I Intend to Gain the Position</h2>
<p>The applicant needs developed analytical and logistical reasoning skills, high-level people management competencies, as well as significant expertise in supply chain network operation, analysis and design, particularly with heavy experience in multi-modal sea, road and rail freight. The applicant would have 15-20 years of industry experience, with proven experience in the role, although perhaps in a smaller-scale operation, and a Master of Logistics and Supply Chain Management.</p>
<p>This position is a 5-10 year goal for me; I have 10 years of industry experience, with 5 years of experience at a national level in operation, analysis and design of multi-million dollar supply chains, compared to billion-dollar supply chains operated by the Toll Group. I am, with luck, within 9 months of completing my Bachelor level qualification in Logistics and Supply Chain Management and already possess Diploma’s in Procurement and Supply and Workplace Health and Safety.</p>
<p>In the next 10 years I will work toward my goal through continued professional development. I will finish my Bachelors and after a period of 6-12 months, in which I will pay off my student debt, I will enroll in the Masters of Logistics and Supply Chain Management through RMIT. I will proceed with this at half pace, aiming to complete the Masters in 11 study periods, or 3 years. I will continue to seek professional challenges in my work, taking on activities I have not conducted before and setting ambitious objectives for the units under my purview. In the meantime I may seek employment in a company in which I believe I can advance my career prospects, either through exposure, reputation or experience, such as taking on a Project or State Procurement or Supply Chain Management role with a tier 1 company based in Australia.</p>

</ul>
</p>
<h2>Learning Styles Test</h2>
<p>I conducted the Learning Styles test on the Personality Max website which is a free and online test. The result is that I am a dominant kinesthetic, or hands-on learner, closely followed by visual-style learning. As such I am characterised as one who prefers learning through activities and experiences rather than recollections and lectures.</p>

<h2>Logical Reasoning test</h2>
<p>In the online Logistical Reasoning Psychometic test I scored in the 93rd percentile, with accuracy of 67% and speed at 100%.</p>
<p>Logistical Reasoning test results https://www.assessmentday.co.uk/logic/free/LogicalReasoningTest1/index.php</p>
<h2>What the Psychometric Test Results Say About Me</h2>
<p>Personality, Learning style and aptitude tests are mechanisms for employers to analyse the characteristics of employees or applicants against a known metric, and can be used to accurately interpret suitability or potential for a role or task. From the results of the test I can reflect on some truths that are highlighted; I am task-oriented, deal well with people so long as I feel I am being “dealt straight”, prefer hands on experience, prefer to understand the situation through visualization, am relatively decisive and am Impulsive. I should be conscious of these things and develop mechanisms to counteract or mitigate the negative manifestations of these traits. For example, I am easily distracted, am task-oriented, work in bursts and are motivated by deadlines. The manifestation of these traits is that I will prioritise my work and “domino” each by significance and due date, but have the potential to leave tasks that I view as lower priority until closer to the deadline, especially if I become fixated or distracted. Therefore I can mitigate the negative consequences by setting myself stretch goals and progressive objectives for each task on my list, and work while having music or a light podcast playing in the background to provide enough stimulation to prevent my mind from wandering.</p>
<p>These traits can influence my behaviour in a team through all stages of the project; formation, planning, and execution. In the formation stage I will and have proven to lead, making introductions and decisions quickly, knowing that others may be uncomfortable in such a role and potentially even relieved having this duty removed from the table. In the planning stage I may become frustrated if too much time is spent discussing aspects which I consider minutiae, and would rather start work so long as the aspect cannot become an obstruction. On the other hand, I enjoy working with people and have significant experience in conflict resolution, so I am able to make decisions on team direction without begrudging others their rightful say. I do not mind if the decision is the “wrong” one, as I would see it, so long as we have sufficient skills, resources and opportunity to overcome the obstacles. In the execution I must be conscious of the project timeline and would have to set operational objectives for myself to ensure my work is delivered in the time and standard required for all others in the team.</p> 
<p>When forming a team I should be conscious of the negative manifestations of my lead traits. During people management training early in my career it was demonstrated to each of us, the value of having different personality types in a work group, each viewing and analysing a situation in a unique way to bring value to the table. I must therefore be conscious that my way of working is not the only way, and that working with the team to develop “our way of working” will lead to greater productivity and a positive working environment.</p>

<div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Project Idea</h1>
<div class="sectionContent">
<article>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The project is to create an application to collate and view motor racing simulator iRacing’s telemetry from all cars in a session which can be overlaid lap-by-lap or all at once in a split-screen view to analyse the throttle input, brake percentage, car speed, direction, car position and lap time for all cars in the same session as the driver. 
<p>The data at each capture point in the selected laps will be available for extraction for the user to generate models to indicate accuracy and performance based on tyre age and wear.
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>iRacing is an online motor racing simulator in which members can participate in races involving existing and known race categories on race circuits from around the world. The growing popularity in conjunction with world events has led to multiple race categories around the world step up involvement in eSports, the Virgin Australia Supercars Championship among them, stepping onto the iRacing platform for a virtual championship series involving real category drivers to be broadcast on Fox Sports.</p>
<p>In such a competitive environment the demand for companion tools for debrief and analyses is high, and the product will have market relevance positioned towards the use by high-level racers to find opportunities in their own car set-ups against their competition, and to make a model of tyre wear for set-up building and race strategy planning.
<p>Similar applications exist in the market, but their failure of imagination results in a model which allows single lap analysis against a selected benchmark, but no easy analysis of trends or allowance for spontaneous events. That lack of perspective makes drawing accurate conclusions difficult.
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The application will essentially have two levels of analytics; the ability to layer the users own lap times in the same session to analyse all the laps completed, and to compare against the laps and telemetry of all the other cars that competed in the same session. The app will measure lap time against distance from the beginning of the lap and will measure car speed, throttle percentage, brake pressure, clutch percentage, steering angle, tyre temperature, car position and lateral G-force.</p>
<p>The data will be displayed in three quadrants; the left half of the screen dedicated to the car telemetry data, with the ability to magnify if necessary, the bottom right quarter of the screen dedicated to the map indicating car position and distance from the start line, and the top right quarter of the screen dedicated to the selection and filter of data, such as lap sectors, car A, Car B, add lap car A, and add lap car B. The lap will be broken down into sectors as dictated by iRacing, and displayed in graphs with a long X axis for distance, and a short Y axis for the measured unit. A focus slider can be manipulated to capture the exact values at any point.</p>
<p>There will be another tab which will allow the user to plot the each individual metric across the entire lap in a chart and overlay every other lap conducted by the same driver in the session. In addition there will be a function box which will allow the user to select a number of laps conducted by the same driver and plot the lap times for the entire lap, or per sector, for the automated generation of a regression line to produce a model of lap time as a function of tyre condition.</p>
<p>Ideally the app will have the rights and ability to access the desired telemetry file directly and automatically sync. There must then be a translation of the data in the telemetry file in app so that the user can detect which lap data corresponds to which driver and in which order the laps were completed. However, if this causes complications the user will instead have to add the desired telemetry files, necessitating “add file” capabilities and instructions, and also necessitating a translation of a telemetry file code into a name which can be easily interpreted by the user.</p>
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>iRacing puts out telemetry data in 3 ways; as a stream into a shared memory location that updates approximately 60 times per second in it’s most limited form, streaming to a file in a YAML format with roughly a 20 second delay with full telemetry, and included in a replay file which is a bigger file is less messy than the YAML file.</p>
<p>The similar products on the market, such as iSpeed and Virtual Racing School, use the YAML file and as such it is known for certain that all desired telemetry can be obtained from this file.</p>
<p>The entire app must be generated in a useful and logical layout for ease of use. As an analytic tool it should be easy to read with intuitive controls for the manipulation of data.</p>
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>A basic level of C++ is highly likely required to interface with the telemetry files from iRacing, particularly to deal with the shared memory file. In addition, a decent level of competency with Node.JS will be required to deal with the YAML format telemetry file. There must also be a very reasonable knowledge or iRacing telemetry files, although this knowledge is readily available on the iRacing forum with staff members that are more than happy to provide such information.</p>
<p>It will be reasonably difficult to learn the skills necessary to create the app. The level of performance of the app will be dictated by the ability to gain competency with the two different programming levels.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>If successful the application would have a significant impact on the preparation of world-championship and other high level drivers as performance can be bench-marked against the top competition from an early stage. This would allow the users the efficient spend of energy; the user can identify and quantify weak areas and divert energy to rectifying the deficiencies.</p>
<p>In addition the gathering of data allows for making greater analyses and drawing accurate conclusions from trends, potentially improving the baseline performance of the user through evolution of car set-ups or improving driving style.</p>
